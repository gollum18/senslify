# Senslify
Suite for managing and viewing sensor data. Senslify is still in the requirements engineering stage of its lifecylce, and this document will evolve to accomadate requirements as they emerge and undergo modification.

## Components
Senslify is made up of three primary components built on top of the Sensor Data Transfer Protocol (SDTP):
+ Client
+ Server
+ Web Service

## Sensor Data Transfer Protocol
SDTP is an open application-layer protocol designed to support sensilfy. The primary design philosophy of SDTP is such that it should be a light protocol, be timely and orderly, and be responsive.
